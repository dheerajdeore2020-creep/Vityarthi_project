1. High chances of errors  

2\. Difficulty in tracking stock levels  

3\. Inefficient invoice generation  

4\. Slow administrative processes  

5\. Risk of duplicate or inconsistent records

##### \### Objectives

1. Build a structured interface to manage customers, products, and sales  

2\. Maintain accurate and up-to-date records of stock and personnel  

3\. Enable efficient report generation and invoice creation  

4\. Improve data consistency and reduce duplication  

5\. Provide clear segregation of administrative and user operations

##### \### Methodology

1\. Frontend (CLI UI in Python)

&nbsp;  Designed a menu-driven interface allowing users to interact with the system easily.



2\. Backend (Python Logic)  

&nbsp;  Implemented functionalities such as:

&nbsp;  - CRUD operations for customers and products  

&nbsp;  - Sales recording and modification  

&nbsp;  - Price, GST, and amount calculations  

&nbsp;  - Data validation and error handling  



3\. Database (MySQL)

&nbsp;  Created relational tables for:

&nbsp;  - Customers  

&nbsp;  - Products  

&nbsp;  - Sales  

&nbsp;  - Billing/Reports  



&nbsp;  Used Primary Keys and Foreign Keys to maintain data integrity.
